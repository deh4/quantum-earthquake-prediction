# Quantum Earthquake Prediction

**Predicting earthquakes using the power of quantum computing.**

---

## Why?

Earthquakes are among the most destructive natural disasters. Early and accurate prediction could save lives, enable better preparedness, and mitigate damage. Quantum computing offers the potential to address the complexities of seismic data analysis and prediction.

---

## What?

This project aims to:
- Define challenges and goals in earthquake prediction.
- Identify and preprocess seismic datasets.
- Develop quantum algorithms for seismic pattern recognition.
- Validate and deploy predictive models.
- Continuously monitor and improve the system.
